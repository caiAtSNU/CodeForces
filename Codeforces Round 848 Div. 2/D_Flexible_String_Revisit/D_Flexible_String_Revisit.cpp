/*
Description
You are given two binary strings a and b of length n.
In each move, the string a is modified in the following way:
    An index 1 <= i <= n is chosen uniformly at random.
    The character a_i will be flipped.
What is the expected number of moves required to make
both strings equal for the first time?

Input
1 <= t <= 1e5
1 <= n <= 1e6
a
b

Output
The expected number modulo 998 244 353
